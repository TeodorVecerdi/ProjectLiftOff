- [ ] Remove World class as it is useless now
- [ ] Remove Sprite usage, in favour of custom classes
- [ ] Add a Fuel Station class
- [ ] Add a render method on classes that show something on screen instead of the RenderSelf override. Then call the render method in the desired order
- [ ] Create a timer class that handles everything related to using a timer such as decreasing time, action on complete (or just having a bool), thus removing clutter in main class
- [ ] Add visibility system
- [ ] Change drill behaviour from hold to toggle, maybe add an additional fuel decrease while drill is on to encourage the player to keep drill off when not needed
